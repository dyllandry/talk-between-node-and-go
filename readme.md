# Talk Between Node & Go

Have you ever had a breakthrough in your understanding of technology which after words you think, _how did I not realize this?_

This project demonstrates when I had the realization that I could actually write two applications, using two different languages, that could communicate across ports.

In summary, this project is both a go app and a node app. They both start up http servers and begin sending each other messages.

## Setup

1. install nodeApp npm dependencies

## Run

_From goApp dir_

1. `go run main.go`

_From nodeApp dir_

1. `node main.js`
